💫 Welcome! 🎉


This backend exercise involves building a Node.js/Express.js app that will serve a REST API. We imagine you should spend around 3 hours at implement this feature.

## Data Models

> **All models are defined in src/model.js**

### Profile
A profile can be either a `client` or a `contractor`. 
clients create contracts with contractors. contractor does jobs for clients and get paid.
Each profile has a balance property.

### Contract
A contract between and client and a contractor.
Contracts have 3 statuses, `new`, `in_progress`, `terminated`. contracts are considered active only when in status `in_progress`
Contracts group jobs within them.

### Job
contractor get paid for jobs by clients under a certain contract.

## Getting Set Up

  
The exercise requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed. We recommend using the LTS version.

  

1. Start by cloning this repository.

  

1. In the repo root directory, run `npm install` to gather all dependencies.

  

1. Next, `npm run seed` will seed the local SQLite database. **Warning: This will drop the database if it exists**. The database lives in a local file `database.sqlite3`.

  

1. Then run `npm start` which should start both the server and the React client.

  

```

Due to restriction of time I skipped several things, but I will mention them here:

* setup validation with Joi
* Better Error Handling
* Unit Testing
* Converting the Project into TypeScripts
